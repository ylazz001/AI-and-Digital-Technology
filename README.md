# Wine Quality Prediction ML

Wine Quality Prediction
Description
This repository contains the R scripts and datasets used in my project on predicting wine quality. The project uses machine learning algorithms such as Random Forests and Support Vector Machines to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties.

Usage
The main scripts for the project are the various R files which load the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance. You can run it in RStudio or any other R environment.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find a bug or have a suggestion for an improvement, please open an issue. If you'd like to contribute code, please fork the repository and make a pull request.

Data
The data used for this analysis was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Dua, D. and Graff, C., 2019). This repository provides access to a wide range of datasets used in the field of machine learning, and the specific dataset used in this project can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml.

The original data was created by Cortez et al. (2009), who modeled wine preferences by mining from physicochemical properties. Their research, which forms the basis for the data used in this project, can be found at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2009.05.016.
